#Neighborhood Map Project

The Neighborhood Map page shows information about five predetermined locations near me using Google Maps and Wikipedia.


##Interaction

There are two modes for accessing information.

Clicking a location name on the left hand pane will:
    *highlight that location name
    *display a description of the place that I entered.
    *display a wikipedia description.
     the wikipedia description is also a link to more info in another tab/window.
    *animate the marker at the selected location.

Clicking on the markers on the map will:
    *activate the pane information as described above.
    *pop up an info window showing the name and my own description.
     infowindows, which are manually opened, must be manually closed.


Locations can be filtered by selecting the desired category in the droplist in the left hand pane.
